# CS-350

What did you do particularly well?
One thing that I did well this term was really learn how to use GPIO and AURTC. I didn't know how to use these previously so this course was definetly a good class to teach me out to be able to integrate them into a TI board. 
Where could you improve?
There are several areas I could improve. The task scheduler is one of those areas that I just didn't quit understand and could have asked for help if I didn't have limited availability. I could also start the coding process sooner so that I have more time to debug and commit updates. 
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
GITHUB is an excellent resource to add to any programmers network. Also I enjoy some of the items on codeacademy.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think understanding the C# language is going to take me far in future projects.
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project was maintainable by breaking down into segments. Each week we completed a different task with the end goal being the same. Making sure to comment on my code allowed me to easily pick up where I left off but also makes it adaptable for others in the future.
